		With the anticipation of youngsters going off to summer vacation on a 

		Cape Cod beach, Zhang Senlin, my wife Qi, and I squeezed into my fully 

		loaded Prius for the long drive to Montreal. A small vase of freshly 

		picked daisies and a bag of grapes graced the front console adding a 

		little romance, style and good fortune to the journey’s start on this 

		sunny Wednesday morning. 

		<p align="left"><br>

		<img border="0" src="images/montreal/sm.JPG" width="300" height="200" align="left" style="border: 2px outset #C0C0C0">For 

		me, the ensuing Montreal days would be spent much like other chorus 

		events—wondering what is being said around me—except that, in Montreal, 

		I had French to bewilder me as well! Mind you, I’m not complaining. I 

		love the music, have many friends and enjoy the events very much. In 

		fact, I imagine my chorus experience is much like what my oldest 

		daughter went through when she landed in the U.S., fresh from Beijing, 

		to enter the first grade without understanding a speck of English. Her 

		classmates still managed to communicate, befriend and play with her in 

		spite of the vastly different communication protocols, much like you 

		guys do with me, especially Zhigang and Jin who I rely on greatly 

		(thanks again and again, guys!!).<br>

		<br>

		Anyway, I’m a fast driver and we were making very good time through 

		Vermont traveling well over the speed limit when a car zoomed past us 

		going at least 10 MPH faster. “That’s Jim Sun,” said Senlin. “Whoa,” I 

		murmured. Somehow, both Jim and I got past the police speed trap without 

		being stopped but, at the border, the Canadian Customs line I got into 

		was faster than the one he got into, and we caught up to him. In 

		Montreal, I made the mistake of abandoning the Google Map I had printed 

		out and followed Jim instead because I knew he had been to Montreal 

		recently. It turned out that he was not looking for the hotel; he was 

		actually looking for a deal again…this time a deal in monetary 

		exchange…and perhaps got a little lost?<br>

		<br>

		Having grown up driving in and around Boston, I was able to adapt to 

		Montreal’s aggressive brand of driving very quickly, which was good 

		because trying to follow Jiping in bumper-to-bumper traffic from 

		Montreal to Laval required some decisive (perhaps a little dangerous?) 

		driving maneuvers with accompanying hand gestures. We would assertively 

		stay right behind Jiping until the last block and then zoom ahead of 

		him, later boasting that we never really needed his GPS-guided 

		leadership in the first place.<br>

		<br>

		One personally satisfying moment came during the opening speeches. Since 

		this was Quebec, of course, French was the first language so the 

		speeches were delivered in French first, then in English. Sitting near 

		Qiao Wanjun in the auditorium, I could see his mind wander as the 

		incomprehensible French continued. So, I seized the opportunity to lean 

		over to him and whisper, “Now you know how I feel” and he laughed.<img src="images/montreal/smandslz.jpg" width="290" height="197" align="right"><br>

		<br>

		Our spirits seemed to follow the weather. The first days were sunny as 

		we rehearsed and performed. We sang perhaps the best I have heard us 

		sing, or at least as good as we were in Xiamen three years ago. We 

		performed well and were quite satisfied with our efforts. Our spirits 

		and optimism ran high as we anticipated an award.<br>

		<br>

		Then, the rain rolled in as we waited hours only to learn that we had 

		not been chosen for the final competition. The stormy weather continued 

		through the final competition as crashing thunder provided dramatic 

		special effects to the performance free-of-charge. <br>

		<br>

		But, you know what they say, behind every storm cloud is a ray of 

		sunshine and, as the weather cleared, we learned that the full chorus 

		had won two second prizes while the ladies had snagged a 

		best-performance award. It was an emotional roller coaster that worked 

		in reverse: the highest point was at the end of the ride. It was a peak 

		made all the higher by the somber disappointment that preceded it. 

		Suffice it to say, the restaurant in Chinatown chosen for the 

		celebration had no doubt seen few parties as joyous and raucous as ours 

		was. I’m sure there was more than a few utterances of “Tsk, tsk. 

		Americans are so loud,” from the other patrons that night. “Just look at 

		that guy toasting with a broken wine glass!”<br>

		<br>

		On Sunday morning, we squeezed back into the Prius with the surprisingly 

		still-fresh daisies and headed south again. As the border drew near, I 

		mentioned that I still had a quantity of Canadian money and wondered if 

		there would be opportunity to spend or exchange it. Just then, we passed 

		an “adult entertainment” establishment and Senlin chuckled, “How about 

		exchanging your money there?” Seeing the same identical poster of a lady 

		multiple times on the outside of the building, I replied, “I would, but 

		my wife would not like seeing you and me fighting over the only lady 

		there.” “I bet there is more than one lady” Senlin replied and added 

		“but I don’t think it is the fighting that Qi would not like.” I agreed 

		and continued on back into the US with a wallet full of Canadian cash 

		and a marriage solidly intact.<br>

		Merci beaucoup, mes bon amis. Votre chanson de Montréal sonnera à mon 

		coeur pendant des années à venir!<br>
